  <chapter no='1'>
    <verse no='1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to  shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he  sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:</verse>
    <verse no='2'>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of  Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of  this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the  time is at hand.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto  you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come;  and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the  first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.  Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father;  to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,  and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall  wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith  the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in  tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in  the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the  testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a  great voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
    <verse no='11'>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,  What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches  which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos,  and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto  Laodicea.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being  turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the  Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the  paps with a golden girdle.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as  snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a  furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his  mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun  shineth in his strength.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid  his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and  the last:</verse>
    <verse no='18'>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive  for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which  are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</verse>
    <verse no='20'>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right  hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels  of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are  the seven churches.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='2'>
    <verse no='1'>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things  saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in  the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</verse>
    <verse no='2'>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how  thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which  say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake  hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast  left thy first love.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,  and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will  remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the  Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of  life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These  things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</verse>
    <verse no='9'>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou  art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and  are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold,  the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and  ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I  will give thee a crown of life.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These  things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</verse>
    <verse no='13'>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where  Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my  faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who  was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast  there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a  stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed  unto idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the  Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will  fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden  manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name  written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These  things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of  fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</verse>
    <verse no='19'>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and  thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because  thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess,  to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat  things sacrificed unto idols.</verse>
    <verse no='21'>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she  repented not.</verse>
    <verse no='22'>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit  adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their  deeds.</verse>
    <verse no='23'>And I will kill her children with death; and all the  churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts:  and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</verse>
    <verse no='24'>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many  as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of  Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</verse>
    <verse no='25'>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</verse>
    <verse no='26'>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end,  to him will I give power over the nations:</verse>
    <verse no='27'>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of  a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my  Father.</verse>
    <verse no='28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
    <verse no='29'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='3'>
    <verse no='1'>And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These  things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven  stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and  art dead.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that  are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and  hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come  on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon  thee.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled  their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are  worthy.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white  raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but  I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These  things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of  David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man  openeth;</verse>
    <verse no='8'>I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open  door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast  kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which  say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to  come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will  keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the  world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that  no man take thy crown.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my  God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of  my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem,  which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him  my new name.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;  These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the  beginning of the creation of God;</verse>
    <verse no='15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I  would thou wert cold or hot.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,  I will spue thee out of my mouth.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,  and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and  miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</verse>
    <verse no='18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that  thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed,  and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine  eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous  therefore, and repent.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my  voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him,  and he with me.</verse>
    <verse no='21'>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my  throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his  throne.</verse>
    <verse no='22'>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto  the churches.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='4'>
    <verse no='1'>After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in  heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet  talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee  things which must be hereafter.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne  was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine  stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like  unto an emerald.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and  upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white  raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings  and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the  throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto  crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,  were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast  like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth  beast was like a flying eagle.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him;  and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night,  saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is  to come.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to  him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</verse>
    <verse no='10'>The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on  the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast  their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
    <verse no='11'>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and  power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are  and were created.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='5'>
    <verse no='1'>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a  book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who  is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,  was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and  to read the book, neither to look thereon.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the  Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open  the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the  four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had  been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven  Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him  that sat upon the throne.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and  twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them  harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of  saints.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take  the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast  redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and  people, and nation;</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we  shall reign on the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round  about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them  was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain  to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and  glory, and blessing.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and  under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,  heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him  that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty  elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='6'>
    <verse no='1'>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I  heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying,  Come and see.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him  had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth  conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second  beast say, Come and see.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was  given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that  they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great  sword.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third  beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he  that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A  measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny;  and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of  the fourth beast say, Come and see.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat  on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto  them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with  hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar  the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the  testimony which they held:</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,  holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that  dwell on the earth?</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it  was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,  until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be  killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo,  there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of  hair, and the moon became as blood;</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig  tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled  together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich  men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and  every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the  mountains;</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us  from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of  the Lamb:</verse>
    <verse no='17'>For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be  able to stand?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='7'>
    <verse no='1'>And after these things I saw four angels standing on the  four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that  the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the  seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four  angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
    <verse no='3'>Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,  till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there  were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of  the children of Israel.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the  tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were  sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the  tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of  Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the  tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar  were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the  tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin  were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no  man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and  tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with  white robes, and palms in their hands;</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God  which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about  the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their  faces, and worshipped God,</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and  thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for  ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are  these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,  These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed  their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him  day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall  dwell among them.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither  shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed  them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God  shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='8'>
    <verse no='1'>And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence  in heaven about the space of half an hour.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to  them were given seven trumpets.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a  golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he  should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar  which was before the throne.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of  the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of  the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and  thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared  themselves to sound.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire  mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third  part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great  mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of  the sea became blood;</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea,  and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star  from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part  of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third  part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters,  because they were made bitter.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun  was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the  stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not  for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of  heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of  the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three  angels, which are yet to sound!</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='9'>
    <verse no='1'>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from  heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless  pit.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke  out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the  air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and  unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the  grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only  those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but  that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the  torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find  it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared  unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and  their faces were as the faces of men.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were  as the teeth of lions.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron;  and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many  horses running to battle.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were  stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the  bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the  Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more  hereafter.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the  four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
    <verse no='14'>Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the  four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an  hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of  men.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred  thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat  on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone:  and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of  their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the  fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their  mouths.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for  their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they  do hurt.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these  plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should  not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and  stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</verse>
    <verse no='21'>Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their  sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='10'>
    <verse no='1'>And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,  clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was  as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his  right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and  when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was  about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up  those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the  earth lifted up his hand to heaven,</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created  heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things  that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that  there should be time no longer:</verse>
    <verse no='7'>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he  shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath  declared to his servants the prophets.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again,  and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the  angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the  little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall  make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate  it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had  eaten it, my belly was bitter.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many  peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='11'>
    <verse no='1'>And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel  stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and  them that worship therein.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>But the court which is without the temple leave out, and  measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city  shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall  prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in  sackcloth.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks  standing before the God of the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their  mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he  must in this manner be killed.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the  days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to  blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast  that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them,  and shall overcome them, and kill them.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great  city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord  was crucified.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations  shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not  suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,  and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two  prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God  entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell  upon them which saw them.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,  Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their  enemies beheld them.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the  tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men  seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the  God of heaven.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh  quickly.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices  in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms  of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on  their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,</verse>
    <verse no='17'>Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art,  and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great  power, and hast reigned.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the  time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest  give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them  that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which  destroy the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was  seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings,  and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='12'>
    <verse no='1'>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed  with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of  twelve stars:</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and  pained to be delivered.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a  great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns  upon his heads.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and  did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which  was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was  born.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all  nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and  to his throne.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a  place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two  hundred and threescore days.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought  against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in  heaven.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called  the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out  into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come  salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of  his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused  them before our God day and night.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the  word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.  Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is  come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath  but a short time.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he  persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that  she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is  nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the  serpent.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after  the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her  mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his  mouth.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make  war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God,  and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='13'>
    <verse no='1'>And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise  up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns  ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his  feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion:  and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and  his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the  beast.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the  beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the  beast? who is able to make war with him?</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things  and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two  months.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to  blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and  to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and  tongues, and nations.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose  names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the  foundation of the world.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>If any man have an ear, let him hear.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he  that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the  patience and the faith of the saints.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and  he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before  him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the  first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down  from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of  those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast;  saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image  to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,  that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many  as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,  free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their  foreheads:</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the  mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the  number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is  Six hundred threescore and six.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='14'>
    <verse no='1'>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and  with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name  written in their foreheads.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many  waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of  harpers harping with their harps:</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and  before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that  song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed  from the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>These are they which were not defiled with women; for they  are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he  goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto  God and to the Lamb.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without  fault before the throne of God.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having  the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and  to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</verse>
    <verse no='7'>Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;  for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven,  and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,  is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the  wine of the wrath of her fornication.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,  If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his  forehead, or in his hand,</verse>
    <verse no='10'>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which  is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he  shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy  angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and  ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and  his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep  the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write,  Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith  the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do  follow them.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud  one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown,  and in his hand a sharp sickle.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud  voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for  the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is  ripe.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the  earth; and the earth was reaped.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,  he also having a sharp sickle.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And another angel came out from the altar, which had power  over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,  saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine  of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and  gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of  the wrath of God.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood  came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of  a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='15'>
    <verse no='1'>And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous,  seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up  the wrath of God.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and  them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,  and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of  glass, having the harps of God.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the  song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God  Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for  thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee;  for thy judgments are made manifest.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the  tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the  seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their  breasts girded with golden girdles.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven  golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,  and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till  the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='16'>
    <verse no='1'>And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the  seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God  upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;  and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the  mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and  it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the  sea.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and  fountains of waters; and they became blood.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous,  O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged  thus.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and  thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God  Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and  power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the  name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not  to give him glory.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the  beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their  tongues for pain,</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and  their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river  Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the  kings of the east might be prepared.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the  mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the  mouth of the false prophet.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which  go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather  them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and  keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And he gathered them together into a place called in the  Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and  there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,  saying, It is done.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and  there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the  earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And the great city was divided into three parts, and the  cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance  before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of  his wrath.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not  found.</verse>
    <verse no='21'>And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every  stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of  the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='17'>
    <verse no='1'>And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven  vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew  unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many  waters:</verse>
    <verse no='2'>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,  and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of  her fornication.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and  I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of  blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and  decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in  her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON  THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints,  and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I  wondered with great admiration.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I  will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth  her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend  out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell  on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of  life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that  was, and is not, and yet is.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are  seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and  the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short  space.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth,  and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which  have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour  with the beast.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength  unto the beast.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall  overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they  that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where  the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and  tongues.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these  shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall  eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to  agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God  shall be fulfilled.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which  reigneth over the kings of the earth.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='18'>
    <verse no='1'>And after these things I saw another angel come down from  heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon  the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,  and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and  hateful bird.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her  fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with  her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the  abundance of her delicacies.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of  her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye  receive not of her plagues.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath  remembered her iniquities.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her  double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to  her double.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously,  so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit  a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and  mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for  strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication  and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her,  when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</verse>
    <verse no='10'>Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,  alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy  judgment come.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over  her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</verse>
    <verse no='12'>The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones,  and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and  all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner  vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense,  and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep,  and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from  thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from  thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,  shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in  fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious  stones, and pearls!</verse>
    <verse no='17'>For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every  shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as  trade by sea, stood afar off,</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying,  What city is like unto this great city!</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and  wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all  that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour  is she made desolate.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and  prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</verse>
    <verse no='21'>And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone,  and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great  city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</verse>
    <verse no='22'>And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and  trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of  whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound  of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;</verse>
    <verse no='23'>And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in  thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard  no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the  earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</verse>
    <verse no='24'>And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints,  and of all that were slain upon the earth.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='19'>
    <verse no='1'>And after these things I heard a great voice of much people  in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and  power, unto the Lord our God:</verse>
    <verse no='2'>For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged  the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and  hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever  and ever.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down  and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,  all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and  as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,  saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the  marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine  linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of  saints.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are  called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me,  These are the true sayings of God.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,  See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that  have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is  the spirit of prophecy.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he  that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he  doth judge and make war.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many  crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his  name is called The Word of God.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white  horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he  should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron:  and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty  God.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,  KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a  loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven,  Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;</verse>
    <verse no='18'>That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of  captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of  them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond,  both small and great.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their  armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the  horse, and against his army.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that  wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had  received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</verse>
    <verse no='21'>And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat  upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the  fowls were filled with their flesh.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='20'>
    <verse no='1'>And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of  the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is  the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and  set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till  the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be  loosed a little season.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was  given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the  witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped  the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their  foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a  thousand years.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand  years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first  resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be  priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand  years.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be  loosed out of his prison,</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the  four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to  battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed  the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down  from God out of heaven, and devoured them.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of  fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and  shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from  whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no  place for them.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and  the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book  of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were  written in the books, according to their works.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and  hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged  every man according to their works.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is  the second death.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was  cast into the lake of fire.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='21'>
    <verse no='1'>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven  and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down  from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the  tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they  shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their  God.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there  shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there  be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all  things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and  faithful.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the  beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the  fountain of the water of life freely.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be  his God, and he shall be my son.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and  murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all  liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and  brimstone: which is the second death.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the  seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying,  Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high  mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending  out of heaven from God,</verse>
    <verse no='11'>Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone  most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at  the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names  of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
    <verse no='13'>On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the  south three gates; and on the west three gates.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them  the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the  city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as  the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand  furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and  four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the  city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished  with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper;  the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</verse>
    <verse no='20'>The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,  chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a  chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</verse>
    <verse no='21'>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate  was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were  transparent glass.</verse>
    <verse no='22'>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and  the Lamb are the temple of it.</verse>
    <verse no='23'>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to  shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the  light thereof.</verse>
    <verse no='24'>And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the  light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour  into it.</verse>
    <verse no='25'>And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for  there shall be no night there.</verse>
    <verse no='26'>And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations  into it.</verse>
    <verse no='27'>And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that  defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but  they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter no='22'>
    <verse no='1'>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as  crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the  river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits,  and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for  the healing of the nations.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and  of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their  foreheads.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,  neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they  shall reign for ever and ever.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true:  and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his  servants the things which must shortly be done.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the  sayings of the prophecy of this book.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had  heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel  which shewed me these things.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy  fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep  the sayings of this book: worship God.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy  of this book: for the time is at hand.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is  filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be  righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to  give every man according as his work shall be.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first  and the last.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may  have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into  the city.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and  murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these  things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and  the bright and morning star.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that  heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever  will, let him take the water of life freely.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the  prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God  shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</verse>
    <verse no='19'>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of  this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life,  and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this  book.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come  quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</verse>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future  generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without  widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular  state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support.    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition.    Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org    This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</verse>
