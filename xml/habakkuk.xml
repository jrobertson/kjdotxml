  <chapter no='1'>
    <verse no='1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even  cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</verse>
    <verse no='3'>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold  grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that  raise up strife and contention.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go  forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong  judgment proceedeth.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder  marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not  believe, though it be told you.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty  nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess  the dwellingplaces that are not their's.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their  dignity shall proceed of themselves.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are  more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread  themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as  the eagle that hasteth to eat.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up  as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be  a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall  heap dust, and take it.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and  offend, imputing this his power unto his god.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?  we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O  mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not  look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal  treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man  that is more righteous than he?</verse>
    <verse no='14'>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping  things, that have no ruler over them?</verse>
    <verse no='15'>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in  their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and  are glad.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense  unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat  plenteous.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare  continually to slay the nations?</verse>

  <chapter no='2'>
    <verse no='1'>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and  will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer  when I am reproved.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and  make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end  it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it  will surely come, it will not tarry.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him:  but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud  man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is  as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations,  and heapeth unto him all people:</verse>
    <verse no='6'>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a  taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that  which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick  clay!</verse>
    <verse no='7'>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and  awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</verse>
    <verse no='8'>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of  the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the  violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse no='9'>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,  that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the  power of evil!</verse>
    <verse no='10'>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many  people, and hast sinned against thy soul.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of  the timber shall answer it.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth  a city by iniquity!</verse>
    <verse no='13'>Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall  labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very  vanity?</verse>
    <verse no='14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the  glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest  thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look  on their nakedness!</verse>
    <verse no='16'>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and  let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall  be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil  of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the  violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse no='18'>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath  graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of  his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</verse>
    <verse no='19'>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb  stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and  silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</verse>
    <verse no='20'>But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep  silence before him.</verse>

  <chapter no='3'>
    <verse no='1'>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</verse>
    <verse no='2'>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,  revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years  make known; in wrath remember mercy.</verse>
    <verse no='3'>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran.  Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his  praise.</verse>
    <verse no='4'>And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out  of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.</verse>
    <verse no='5'>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth  at his feet.</verse>
    <verse no='6'>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove  asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the  perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</verse>
    <verse no='7'>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of  the land of Midian did tremble.</verse>
    <verse no='8'>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger  against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride  upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?</verse>
    <verse no='9'>Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the  tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</verse>
    <verse no='10'>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing  of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his  hands on high.</verse>
    <verse no='11'>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the  light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering  spear.</verse>
    <verse no='12'>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst  thresh the heathen in anger.</verse>
    <verse no='13'>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for  salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house  of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</verse>
    <verse no='14'>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his  villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing  was as to devour the poor secretly.</verse>
    <verse no='15'>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through  the heap of great waters.</verse>
    <verse no='16'>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the  voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that  I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people,  he will invade them with his troops.</verse>
    <verse no='17'>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit  be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields  shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and  there shall be no herd in the stalls:</verse>
    <verse no='18'>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my  salvation.</verse>
    <verse no='19'>The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like  hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the  chief singer on my stringed instruments.</verse>
